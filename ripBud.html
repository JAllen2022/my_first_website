        <h1>Happy trails, Bud. You'll always be the best boy.</h1>
        <p>
            I didn't have the chance to say goodbye to you on your last day, Bud. I regret not leaving as soon as I heard the news that you hadn't woken up that day.
            I remember receiving a call from mom that morning, her crying and telling me that you had passed away in your sleep. I was devestated. All I could do was cry.
            I knew the call was coming. The last few weeks of your life were pretty rough - you had trouble walking, you slept a lot, and it seemed like the time was coming.
        </p>
        <p>
            I cried in the shower for a while, maybe 30 or 40 minutes, when I heard my phone ring again. It was mom, and she told me you came back to consciousness.
            She said to hurry home, and that you were waiting for me to come back to say goodbye to me one last time. I wish I had left as soon as I heard you hadn't woken up.
            I knew every minute counted as you were on your last few breathes.
        </p>

        <p>
            It pains me to this day that I didn't make it back in time. I wish I could've hugged you and saw that beautiful grin on your face one last time.
            You were a loving soul, Bud. I have some regrets, regrets that I didn't take you out on enough walks, play enough catch with you, or shown you enough of the world.
            I hope that the love I gave you was enough. I hope you knew how much I loved you.
        </p>

        <p>
            I can't put into words how much I miss you. You were, and still are, the best boy.
