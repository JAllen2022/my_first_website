        <h2>Gigi's Bio:</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Gigi. I'm a 9 year old border collie. I was adopted when I was 3 months old, into a family of 3 and another dog named Bud.
            Bud was about 5 at the time and was the absolute best older brother I could've asked for. I would climb, bite, and play all over him and he wouldn't mind at all.
            My favorite activity was to cuddle and sleep right next to him.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I wasn't running around bothering my older Brother, I would adventure around the big yard around the house.
            There were so many things to climb, holes to dig, squarels to chase after, oh boy. There was so much to do, and so little time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that I'm a little older, and a little wiser. I take my time destroying our beautiful yard. I love digging, that's one of my favorite activities, especially when my older brother Jason
            digs with me. I also love adventuring ~ whether it be walks or runs! I especially enjoy runs.
        </p>
